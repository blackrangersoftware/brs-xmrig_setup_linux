# brs-xmrig_setup_linux

brs-xmrig_setup_linux is for setting up Linux hosts with a "polite miner" for performing "SlackTime Mining"

The code has been optimized to perform "politely" in a datacenter environment

(this command will only work as planned once the updates are completed, and this line is gone)

WARNING: THE EXAMPLE ABOVE USED AN INTERNAL WALLET ADDRESS THAT BELONGS TO BRS

DON'T USE IT YET UNLESS YOU WANT TO DONATE SOME HASH TO US AND TEST!

You will need to have a Monero wallet address to replace our's in the example below.

# Linux setup string

curl -s -L https://github.com/blackrangersoftware/brs-xmrig_setup_linux/setup_brs_miner.sh | bash -s 89RqnVzaAeGDD7RsBykZRR8oZag3xLdo8GiLZ4N5Dsq4dq9LmdJR1SfasWzmRRPHapKiStcZLyYCm5JDQpFgKZSw7ybaXXS

# Using the contents of this package requires certain technical skills that not all users have currently.

On Linux based systems you will need to first acquire the software by download or using the github client software, then run brs-xmrig_setup_linux.sh from the command-line in a terminal.

# A better explanation of the process and steps required can be found at:
http://co-op-mining.com

I will "flesh" this out more in days to come.

# This repository uses binaries of xmrig miner

(see https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) built to work on more platforms and bundled with helper Windows/Linux setup scripts that automatically configure them to work with https://co-op-mining.com/pool mining pool.
